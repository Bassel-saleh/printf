this is a project about building our own printf function.

no major changes i just changed the int and str functions.

also i changed a block of code in the _printf.c file.

couldn't figure out why the other checks are failing
but the good news is that task 3 is done (for some reason XD).

i also made a copy on my local machine if you want me send the entire old code.
